          explanation: "Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include classification and regression. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, deals with unlabeled data. The model tries to identify patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance. Common tasks include clustering (e.g., K-Means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)."

          question: "What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?",

          explanation: "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the noise or random fluctuations in the training data instead of the underlying patterns. This leads to high accuracy on the training data but poor performance on unseen data. Overfitting can be prevented by using techniques such as cross-validation, reducing model complexity, applying regularization (e.g., L1 or L2 penalties), using more training data, or employing dropout in neural networks."

          explanation: "Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or 'folds'. The model is trained on some folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated multiple times, and the results are averaged to provide a robust estimate of the model's performance. Cross-validation helps detect overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data."

          question: "What is the bias-variance tradeoff?",
          maxWords: 150,
          explanation: "The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the balance between two sources of error in a machine learning model. Bias represents errors due to overly simplistic models that fail to capture the underlying patterns (underfitting). Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too complex and overly sensitive to fluctuations in the training data (overfitting). The goal is to find a model complexity that minimizes both bias and variance to achieve optimal performance."

It displays the counts of true positives (correctly predicted positives), true negatives (correctly predicted negatives), false positives (incorrectly predicted positives), and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negatives). Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be derived from the confusion matrix to provide insights into the model's performance on different classes."

          explanation: "A decision tree is a single predictive model that splits the data into branches based on feature values to make predictions. It is prone to overfitting, especially with complex datasets. A random forest, on the other hand, is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features, and their outputs are aggregated (via voting for classification or averaging for regression). Random forests are more robust and less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees."

      //       maxWords: 300,
      //       explanation: "To calculate the average waiting time using FCFS scheduling, we first compute the waiting time for each process. The waiting time is the amount of time a process has been in the ready queue before it gets executed. FCFS scheduling executes processes in the order they arrive. For this case, assuming processes arrive in the order A, B, C, D, the waiting times are as follows:\n\n- Process A: 0 ms (as it is the first to execute).\n- Process B: 5 ms (Process A runs for 5 ms before Process B starts).\n- Process C: 13 ms (Process A runs for 5 ms, and Process B runs for 8 ms before Process C starts).\n- Process D: 16 ms (Process A runs for 5 ms, Process B runs for 8 ms, and Process C runs for 3 ms before Process D starts).\n\nNow, calculate the average waiting time:\n\n(0 + 5 + 13 + 16) / 4 = 34 / 4 = 8.5 ms.

      //       maxWords: 300,
      //       explanation: "In this scenario, the Banker's Algorithm helps avoid deadlock by ensuring that resource allocation always leaves the system in a safe state. The algorithm checks if it is possible to allocate resources to processes without causing a deadlock. Here's how the allocation would proceed:\n\n1. First, calculate the remaining resource needs for each process. The remaining need is the difference between the maximum allocation and the resources already allocated.\n\n- P1 needs {A: 0, B: 0, C: 0} (Maximum allocation equals allocated resources).\n- P2 needs {A: 0, B: 0, C: 0}.\n- P3 needs {A: 0, B: 0, C: 0}.\n\n2. Next, check if the system has enough available resources to meet the needs of any process. In this case, the available resources are {A: 3, B: 3, C: 2}, which are sufficient to meet the needs of all processes.\n\n3. The system will proceed to allocate resources to each process. Since all processes have no remaining resource needs, the allocation proceeds without causing deadlock.\n\nThus, the system remains in a safe state and avoids deadlock."

      //       maxWords: 300,
      //       explanation: "The Producer-Consumer problem can be solved using semaphores to synchronize the access to a shared buffer. The solution involves two semaphores: one for counting the number of full slots in the buffer (`full`), and another for counting the number of empty slots (`empty`). Additionally, a mutex (`mutex`) is used to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared buffer.\n\n1. Initialize the semaphores:\n\n- `full` is initialized to 0, representing that the buffer is initially empty.\n- `empty` is initialized to the total number of buffer slots (say N), representing that all slots are empty.\n- `mutex` is initialized to 1, ensuring mutual exclusion during access.\n\n2. Producer process:\n\n- The producer waits for an empty slot (`empty.wait()`), ensuring that there is space to produce.\n- It then locks the buffer using `mutex.wait()` to ensure exclusive access to the buffer.\n- After adding an item to the buffer, the producer signals that a slot is now full (`full.signal()`), and releases the lock (`mutex.signal()`).\n\n3. Consumer process:\n\n- The consumer waits for a full slot (`full.wait()`), ensuring that there is an item to consume.\n- It locks the buffer (`mutex.wait()`), consumes the item, and then signals that a slot is now empty (`empty.signal()`), releasing the lock (`mutex.signal()`).\n\nThis ensures that producers and consumers work efficiently without interfering with each other, and the shared buffer is accessed in a synchronized manner."

      //       maxWords: 300,
      //       explanation: "When a process switches from user mode to kernel mode during a system call, the following steps are involved:\n\n1. The process executes an instruction that triggers a system call, such as reading from a file or allocating memory.\n\n2. The processor switches from user mode to kernel mode. This is done by saving the current state of the process (such as the program counter, registers, and flags) and loading the state of the kernel.\n\n3. The kernel verifies the validity of the system call and checks any necessary permissions. It may also check the parameters passed by the process to ensure they are valid.\n\n4. The kernel performs the required task, such as accessing hardware or managing system resources. The kernel has full access to system resources, unlike user mode, which has limited access.\n\n5. Once the system call is complete, the kernel prepares the process to return to user mode by saving its state and restoring the state of the process that made the system call.\n\n6. Finally, the processor switches back to user mode, and the process resumes execution from the point where it left off before the system call.\n\nThis mode switch ensures that processes are executed securely and efficiently, with the kernel managing system-level tasks."
